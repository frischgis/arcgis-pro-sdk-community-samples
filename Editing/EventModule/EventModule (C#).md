##How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used. To use images in this section, create the image file in your sample project's screenshots folder. Use relative url to link to this image using this syntax: ![My sample Image](FacePage/SampleImage.png) -->
In Pro there are two types of edit events you can subscribe to; row based events for create/change/delete on rows, and edit completed events for when an edit operation completes. Both can get you similar information but the row events give you more control and information during the edit as compared to after it. You can subscribe to these events within a custom control or using a module without any controls, similar to extensions in ArcMap.
To create an add-in that acts like an extension, the module must be set to autoLoad = true in Config.daml. Your code is then placed in the Initialize method for the module.<br />  
Edit completed events listen to all layers in all maps. Row events listen for specific changes to specific tables. Since the module is initialized before the project's maps and layers, you subscribe to these events after the project is opened.
To use this sample you can either compile and open Pro or run through the Visual Studio debugger.<br />  
You should see edit and row events fired while editing data.<br />  
To stop this add-in you can delete it with the add-in manager in the application.
